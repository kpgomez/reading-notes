## Psychological Safety
[Source]()

Psychologically safe teams and work cultures produce better outcomes. It might lead to increased collaboration, and lower turnover among other things. 

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? conversational turn-taking, empathy, and mutual respect

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. I personally think psychological safety starts with the manager. I've had great managers that seem to really care about my well-being, and the work that I'm doing and other managers who I sensed were just trying to cover themselves in case something goes wrong. The morale was definitely lower in the setting where psychological safety was not practiced. Meetings were unproductive. Team members didn't really collaborate and sometimes folks were guarded about sharing knowledge. 

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? they're more effective, have a higher I.Q. collectively, and the team members may possibly have a greater sense of purpose
