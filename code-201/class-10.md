## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. Syntax errors have error messages and are usually easier to fix. Logic error has no errors the computer can detect but it doesn't do what we intended it to do. 

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. MIME error was due to an incorrect path name. I corrected this by adding the ./ to the file path. I definitely had a few logic errors and those took forever to correct. Console.log() is my best friend when trying to figure out what went wrong.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals? I want to be a solid developer and on my path to being a decent developer is to break the code so I can have plenty of practice fixing it.

## The JavaScript Debugger.

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development? The JavaScript Debugger tool is developer's best friend that lives inside the browser. It helps you find errors, find solutions all live but in a test environment without making any permanent changes. 

2. Define what a breakpoint is. It is places in your code that you want to pause execution. 

3. What is the call stack? The order in which code or functions are executed.
