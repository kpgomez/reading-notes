## HTML Forms

## Your first Web Form

Web forms use the *input* element

Form controls (widgets) can be single or multi-line, drop-down boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons

They can also validate user input and enforce specific formats or values

It is important to request only necessary data from the user to reduce user frustration

HTML form elements
- form
- label (attributes *for*)
- input (attributes *type*, *id*, *name*)
- textarea (attributes *id*, *name*)
- button

All forms start with a *form* container element

form attributes
- action defines the URL where the form's input data will be sent
- method defines which HTPP method, *get* or *post*

Events are fired inside the browser window and are attached to an to a specific item that resides in it

Types of Events
- user selection, click, or cursor hover
- key input
- resizing or closing of browser window
- web page finishes loading
- form submission
- video is played, paused, or ends
- errors

Event handler is a block of code that runs when an event fires

Event objects (event, evt, e)

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend? User does an action and that action results in another action from the computer/webpage
2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide? the event to listen for (event type), and the function call
3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful? 
4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing? The order is reversed in Event capture
