# Mozilla HTML Basics

[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

<p>HTML defines the structure of a webpage's content through series of elements. The anatomy of an element starts with an opening tag i.e. '<' and ends with closing tag '>', and the verbiage in between is the content.
Elements can also have attributes which is extra information about the element such as **class**.  Class attribute is a non-unique identifier that can be used to tell the browser 'hey these elements are in the same class or group and should look the same, etc.' </p>

> Attributes that set a value always have:
>> 1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes). 
>> 2. The attribute name followed by an equal '=' sign.
>> 3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

# Semantics

[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)

'Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code'

1. Be sure to name functions, variables, etc meaningfully

2. HTML should be coded to only represent the content
3. CSS should be coded to only represent presentation or styling of the content

Best practice is to 'use the right HTML element for the right job'

Semantic markup is very important for [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO)

## Useful Semantic Elements

- article
- aside
- detail
- figcaption
- figure
- footer
- header
- main
- mark
- nav
- section
- summary
- time

These all go inside a '<>'.
