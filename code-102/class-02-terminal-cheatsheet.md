# Cheatsheet

## The Command Line (Terminal)

- Command e.g., ls is separated from its command line arguments with a space. 
- The first command line argument is referred to as an option and is listed 1st. Options start with a -
- bash stands for **B**ourne **A**gain **SH**ell
- echo is a command used to display msgs

## Basic Navigation

- pwd stands for Print Working Directory
- ls stands for List 
- ~ shortcut for home dir
- . reference to current dir (not sure what that actually means)
- .. ref parent dir
- cd is change directory

Two types of paths; absolute and relative. Absolutes start with a / and relative paths do not

## More About Files

- Everything is a FILE??
- Linux is case-sensitive. Who woulda thunk?
- . denotes hidden file. ls will not show hidden files/directories unless -a is used 

## Things I want to know

- does hacking or cyberattacks happen in the Terminal?
