## Introduction to JavaScript - basic output

You can embed JS code directly inside or ref the external JS file in the HTML file

Best practice is to use external file

### Input/Output

- alert("msg") //displays as pop-up in the browser with the text
- document.write("msg") //changes content of the page
- console.log("msg") //helps with debugging information

## JavaScript input with prompt and confirm

prompt and confirm are **FANCY**

'[Prompt] will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in. When the user presses OK, the value in the text box will be returned by the prompt() function. Then, in this example we use the document.write method to update the html with the text.'

Confirm() allows the dev to ask yes/no question
