CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

Each browser has their own internal stylesheet

CSS is rule-based

CSS rule opens with a selector aka HTML element followed by curly braces and inside the brace will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property: value pairs.

A good rule is to list each selector in the same order as the HTML file and within each declaration, try to list in A-Z order for easier reference at a later date.

CSS language is broken down into modules such as [Backgrounds and Borders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders)

'CSS works **VERY HARD** to never change things in a way that would break old websites. '
