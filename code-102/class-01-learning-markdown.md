## Class 01

# Markdown Basic Syntax

# Basic Syntax

- Heading level begins with H1 which is the largest font size and ranges to H6 which is the smallest size
- == is alternate syntax for H1
- -- is alternate syntax for H2
- Always put a space between the special character and the string/text, as well as after
- <p> starts a paragraph
- <br> starts a line break. End the line with two spaces or more
- **text** or __text__ rep bold text (referred to as 'strong' in HTML) 
- single * or _ italicizes 
- triple * or _ rep both bold and italics
- > blockquotes which is a grayed out area of text with a gray bar on left hand side
- >> creates nested block quotes  
- ol = ordered list
- ul = unordered list
- li = list item
- best practice is to use universal characters
- \ escapes the .
