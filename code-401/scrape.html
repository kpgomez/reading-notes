    encomienda was a grant of the labor of a particular indigenous settlement to an individual Spanish and his heirs.
    Spaniards were the recipients of traditional indigenous products that had been rendered in tribute to their local
    lords and to the Aztec empire. The earliest holders of encomiendas, the encomenderos were the conquerors involved in
    the campaign leading to the fall of Tenochtitlan, and later their heirs and people with influence but not
    conquerors. Forced labor could be directed toward developing land and industry. Land was a secondary source of
    wealth during this immediate conquest period. Where indigenous labor was absent or needed supplementing, the Spanish
    brought slaves, often as skilled laborers or artisans.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact"
