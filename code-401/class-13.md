## Reading Questions

1. Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis? Linear regression is used to determine if there is a relationship between different values or variables and outcomes. It is used in machine learning to create simple models. 

2. Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions. Import packages such as numpy and sklearn.linear_model LinearRegression class. Create a LinearRegression instance. Obtain the R squared (coefficient of determination), intercept, slope, and its response. 


3. What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance? The dataset for training is used to create the model. The dataset for tests is to evaluate how good the model is on simulated data.
