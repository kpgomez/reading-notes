## Trees

Notes: 

1. Pre-order is left, root, right

2. In-order is root, left, right

3. Post-order is left, right, root

4. Depth (how deep) traversal is based on tree height (how many levels)

5. Breadth (how broad) traversal is based on tree width (how many leafs/nodes are on the last level)

6. Most common method for depth traversal is utilizing recursion and the built-in call stack

7. Most common method for breadth traversal is utilizing a Queue. As we traverse the nodes we dequeue the current root and enqueue its child nodes
