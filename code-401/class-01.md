The following material is to mentally and emotionally prepare me for the upcoming session

I enjoy a challenge so let's do this!

## Pain and Suffering
[Source](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

The article reminded me of a favorite lyric by rapper D Smoke from Rhythm and Flow. 
"..growth is an uncomfortable process and pain is a necessary investment for progress..."

According to the artile, "Suffering is pain with purpose". The pain I will endure in the next 5 months will propel me forward in my career, in what I can provide for my family, and hopefully closer to the dream of buying our first home, and moving back to a big city.

## Beginners Guide to Big O
[Source](https://robbell.io/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation)

O(1) - algorithm where execution time is **constant** no matter how big or small the input data set is

O(N) - algorithm performance is directly proportional to the number of size of input data set, the shape is a **straight line**, loops

O(N^2) - algorithm performance is directly proportional to the **square** of the size of the input data set, nested loops

O(2^N) - growth doubles with each additional input, **exponential**, recursions

Logarithms's is the inverse of exponents. It quickly peaks and then sort of flat lines, binary search

I have to rewatch this and at a much slower pace.

## Reading Questions

1. In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

The main challenges is getting used to the syntax and other differences when compared to other languages. My two strategies for overcoming these challenges is to type out the code examples as often as possible and to do it in the IDLE to get immediate feedback from small snippets of code. 

2. After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity refers to how fast the execution time or how efficient the algorithm is. Space complexity refers to how much memory it uses.

3. Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python. 

Mutable data types can be changed in place such as lists. Immutable data types cannot be changed in place such as tuples.
