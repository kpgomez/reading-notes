[Basic Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEJSJMg4jY)

Every recursive function has a base case and a recursive case, otherwise it will never exit. 

[Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)

- Linked List

- Arrays, memory location is next to each other

- Hash Table aka dictionary in Python, memory location is random

- Stack (LIFO) & Queue (FIFO)

- Graphs & Trees

## Discussion Questions
1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

Efficiency

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack? 

Make sure the recursive function has a base case that terminates the function.
