## Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can? 

I bring my intense curiosity and desire to know how all the pieces in an organization fit together. With the exception of one role where school was my first priority, I always exceed all of my manager's expectations. One manager described me as someone who likes to deliver everything on a "silver platter", and my last manager tried very hard to convince me to stay. He offered two raises within a year, an offer for the company to pay for 60% of my master's degree should I wish to continue my education. The only reason I stayed a bit longer after turning in my notice was he hired my little sister so I spent a few months giving her a very thorough training.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature? 

Take a break, start fresh, bounce ideas off other people, or google it so I can look at how other people solved the same problem so I don't reinvent the wheel unless absolutely necessary.
