This article seems similar to how I apply myself to pool. Instead of playing to get better, I complete boring drills mainly to ensure my fundamentals are solid. I find that when I have good fundamentals and good muscle memory, I can execute difficult shots more easily. I guess I can apply this same methodology to my coding journey.

I love TedTalks and appreciate my OPMA professor for introducing me to them and making the class watch them as part of our assignments. 

Praise the process, not the result. Celebrate growth and learning.

### Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

I have to honest with myself and I have concluded that I am not very gritty, but I have close friends and love ones who are and whom I admire and aspire to be more like. One of them came to visit with her family last weekend and brought a book to read during her downtime. The books was called Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. I don't love to read. I listen to audiobooks about self-improvement during long road trips but I don't think I have ever read a nonfiction book, for fun or not, from cover to cover, ever. So to rectify this, and to hopefully start new habits I have this goal to read a nonfiction book in its entirely within the year. The book I chose for right now is Cribsheet, a book given to me by the same friend. And with these new habits, over time I hope to become more gritty.

### EQ assessment

I don't remember the results of my last assessment but I think I've grown in the areas of self and relationship management but need to continue to work on my self-awareness.

### Bias assessment

My strongest area is meaningful connections and weakest is effective courage. My areas of focus during the next couple months will be effective courage along with bias and the brain.
