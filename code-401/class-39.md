## Reading Questions
1. What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application? [ChatGPT Prompt](https://chat.openai.com/c/237717bf-ef42-4c0a-bc88-58ba44bdbe3b)
> It is a different way to share state or configuration information between components without explicit passing of such data. 
2. Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component. [ChatGPT Prompt]()
> useContext hook is used to access the value of a React Context. To use it, you import useContext then create Context, pass in the Provider value to hold data, and pass in Consumer value to consume data. 
3. Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.
> The purpose is so you can build a full stack application without a secondary framework whereas in React you can only do client-side rendering, Next.js allows both client and server-side.
