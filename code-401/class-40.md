The last article about HoloLen's AR technology reminded me of the Black Mirror episode, Men Against Fire. I fully agree with the engineers that protested the project since  it would only contribute to monetary gains for the company but at the expense and the detriment of the public good, and it was unethical. The one thing I learned during college and despised was the idea that CEOs and executives were beholden to the company shareholders, and that the advice was to make decisions that increased value for the shareholders. Everyone else didn't really matter. There was a simulation during my capstone where we had to determine the number of people to lay-off in order to increase short-term profits. It was a bizarre exercise. Technology is so powerful. You can create anything you can imagine. This sounds cliche, but it is absolutely true that with great power comes great responsibility. We should be beholden to each other, not to dollar signs.

If possible, I would like to read the second article "Will democracy survie big data and AI" later when I am feeling less anxious.
