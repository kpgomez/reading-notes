### Microsoft and the DOD
This article reminded me of the Black Mirror episode, Men Against Fire. I fully agree with the engineers that protested the project since it would only contribute to monetary gains for the company but at the expense and the detriment of the public good which made it unethical. The one thing I learned and despised during college was the idea that CEOs and executives were beholden to the company shareholders, and that the advice was to make decisions that increased value for the shareholders. Everyone else, such as long-time employees, didn't really matter. Another instance I thought was strange was during my capstone class. We had a capitalism simulation where we had to act as CEOs and make strategic decisions about market price, number of shares, etc. One of the exercises, we had to determine the number of people to lay-off in order to increase short-term company profits. People were just numbers that could be deposed of to make the bottom line better. I thought it was a bizarre exercise. What was the lesson they were trying to teach us here? To summarize, I think technology is powerful. You can create anything you can imagine. This sounds cliche, but it is absolutely true that with great power comes great responsibility. We should be beholden to each other, the public good, and not ever to dollar signs over the public good.


### Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?
I agree partially with the article specifically when it comes to educational reforms and right to copy of personal data. The rest of the article seemed more about how to implement a new government system or guidelines for regulation of personal data. I learned some new terms such as super intelligence (didn't know that was a thing), persuasive computing, and big nudging.  All of this data collection, with or without our consent, is quite frightening and an invasion of our personal privacy. It's also discriminatory, especially how, this data collection is used in China with its citizen score. My personal data should not up for sale without my consent. I should have open access to information. The information I receive should not be based on previous queries. This disrupts the free exchange of ideas and opinions.
