***Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:***

|SQL	 |NoSQL    |
| :---:  | :---:   |
table-based| 	   document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores  |     | 
| 	    pre-defined schema |  dynamic schema        |
| 	    vertically scaleable by increasing the horsepower of the hardware|        horizontally scaleable by increasing the number of servers |
| 	   uses SQL for defining and manipulating data  |  uses UnQL      |
|   relational     |   distributed      |

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? Record management. Give a real world example. School databases, banks

2. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? Big Data, videos, images, paragraphs of text. Give a real world example. Facebook, Instagram

3. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL

4. Which type of database is best for scalability? SQL databases scale by increasing power and NoSQL databases scale by adding more servers so I would say that SQL are best for scalability

1. What does SQL stand for? Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database? A database that consists of a bunch of related tables with a strong schema
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with? tables
4. What is a ‘schema’? defines which data can go in which table via fields(columns)
5. What is a NoSQL database? a database that consists of collections and documents
6. How does it work? related data live together in the same collection
7. What is inside of a MongoDB database? collections and documents
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. there is no strict schema in MongoDB and can scale horizontally by adding more servers
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? duplication of data if the same data lives in different collections or documents
