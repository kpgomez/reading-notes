1. Who is Roy Fielding? Helped write the first web servers 
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? Machines don't have a universal communication protocolo for specifying nouns other than the URL
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and it's basically a set of rules for how computers communicate with one another and exchange information on the world wide web
4. What does a GET do? Retrieves informations
5. What does a POST do? Adds information
6. What does PUT do? Updates  information
7. What does PATCH do? Partially updates information
