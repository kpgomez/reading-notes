**Notes**

Decomposition ([Source](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zqqfyrd/revision/1#:~:text=Decomposition%20is%20one%20of%20the,are%20simpler%20to%20work%20with.))
- breaks down a complex problem into simpler problems that are easier to manage and solve
- one of 4 cornerstones of Computer Science
- Other cornerstones include Abstraction, Pattern recognition, Algorithms. These are all a sub-set of Computational Thinking

A component can have 3 views: object-oriented, conventional, and process-related

**Q&A**

1. What is a “component”?

**Answer:** A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface. It can be deployed independently. It encapsulates very specific functionality.

2. What are the characteristics of a component?

**Answer:** Reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, independent

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

**Answer:** Ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, independent
