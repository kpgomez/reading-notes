## React Lifecycle


**Q&A**
1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the `componentDidMount`? Render
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React? A constructor is mounted
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: 
    - `constructor`
    - `render`
    - `React Updates`
    - `componentDidMount`
    - `componentWillUnmount`
4. What does `componentDidMount` do? initializes the DOM or assists with loading a network request such as connecting to APIs


## React State VS Props

**Notes**
props are arguments to a function, things you pass, 

**Q&A**
1. What types of things can you pass in the props? Counter, attributes such as titles, description
2. What is the big difference between props and state? Props are passed into and are handled outside of the component whereas states reside and are handled inside of the component
3. When do we re-render our application? When the state changes
4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state? Inside of a form like checkboxes, text that changes based on user input
